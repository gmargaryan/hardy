   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

               <xhtml:p>In 10.13 Apple added a "Lock Screen" option to the Apple Menu. Prior to this the best quick lock options were to use either a lock screen option with the screen saver or the lock screen option from Keychain Access if status was made available in the menu bar. With 10.13 the menu bar option is no longer available.
The intent of this control is to resemble control-alt-delete on Windows Systems as a means of quickly locking the screen. If the user of the system is stepping away from the computer the best practice is to lock the screen and setting a hot corner is an appropriate method.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>macOS does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.</xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:p>The SSH server built-in to macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications including email, web browser and productivity tools should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management tool-sets that do utilize SSH, if they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known trusted IP addresses and appropriate admin service accounts.</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p>For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:ul>
                           <xhtml:li>Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks, this is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark</xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:ol>
                  <xhtml:li>Apple File Protocol (AFP) AFP automatically uses encrypted logins, so this method of sharing files is fairly secure. The entire hard disk is shared to administrator user accounts. Individual home folders are shared to their respective user accounts. Users' "Public" folders (and the "Drop Box" folder inside) are shared to any user account that has sharing access to the computer (i.e. anyone in the "staff" group, including the guest account if it is enabled).</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Server Message Block (SMB), Common Internet File System (CIFS) When Windows (or possibly Linux) computers need to access file shared on a Mac, SMB/CIFS file sharing is commonly used. Apple warns that SMB sharing stores passwords is a less secure fashion than AFP sharing and anyone with system access can gain access to the password for that account. When sharing with SMB, each user that will access the Mac must have SMB enabled.</xhtml:li>

Since the service allows every device associated with the users ID to synchronize and have access to the cloud storage the concern is not just about having sensitive data on Apple's servers but having that same data on the phone of the teenage son or daughter of an employee.

            <xhtml:p>One of the most important IT Operational concerns is to ensure that information is protected against loss or tampering. The purpose of the IT devices is to process the data after all. At one time the cost of IT equipment and the volume of the data might make the protection of the equipment itself more important, at this point the vast size of data archives and the lower cost of end user equipment makes data protection central to operational planning. Backup strategies are generally focused on ensuring that there are multiple copies of relevant versions of user files. The plan is that no single hardware or software loss or failure will result in major data loss.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Apple introduced Time Machine in 2007 as a simple to use built-in mechanism for users to ensure that their machine was backed up and if there was a mistake or loss information could be easily recovered. There are other solutions to ensure information is protected including several Enterprise solutions and simple drive or directory cloning.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>One of the most important security tools for data protection on macOS is FileVault. With encryption in place it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting-up a time machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>Password security is an important part of general IT security where passwords are in use. For macOS passwords are still much more widely used than other methods for account access. While there are other authentication and authorization methods for access from an macOS computer to organizational services, console access to the Mac is probably done using a password. This section contains password controls.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Recent updates based on research by NIST in SP800-63 call in to question traditional password complexity and rotation requirements. Sticky notes are not a password management program and password vault APIs are under increasing attack and ideally the user will remember their important passwords. The new understanding has informed changes to the previous password recommendations.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Length, Threshold and a yearly rotation requirement are the only scored controls below. Other controls will remain as unscored options. Passwords used for macOS are likely to also function as encryption keys for FileVault and depending on the information confidentiality on FileVault volumes stronger passwords may be required than are necessary to pass the controls in this Benchmark.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Apple supported solutions for managing local passwords on macOS are to use either an XML file that contains password rules that are imported with pwpolicy or through the use of a profile. In either case the controls in this section can be implemented with organizationally approved password policy.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Over time passwords can be captured by third parties through mistakes, phishing attacks, third party breaches or merely brute force attacks. To reduce the risk of exposure and to decrease the incentives of password reuse (passwords that are not forced to be changed periodically generally are not ever changed) users must reset passwords periodically. This control ensures that previous passwords are not reused immediately by keeping a history of previous passwords hashes. Ensure that password history checks are part of the password policy on the computer. This control checks whether a new password is different than the previous 15.
The latest NIST guidance based on exploit research referenced in this section details how one of the greatest risks is password exposure rather than password cracking. Passwords should be changed to a new unique value whenever a password might have been exposed to anyone other than the account holder. Attackers have maintained persistent control based on predictable password change patterns and substantially different patterns should be used in case of a leak.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>The login keychain is a secure database store for passwords and certificates and is created for each user account on macOS. The system software itself uses keychains for secure storage. Anyone with physical access to an unlocked keychain where the screen is also unlocked can copy all passwords in that keychain. Application access to the login keychain does not keep it unlocked. If you set Apple Mail to check for email every 10 minutes using the keychain for credentials and the keychain to lock every 15 minutes if inactive it will still cause the keychain to lock. The approach recommended here is that the login keychain be set to periodically lock when inactive to reduce the risk of password exposure or unauthorized use of credentials by a third party. The time period that an organization uses will depend on how great the use is of keychain aware applications. Organizations that use Firefox and Thunderbird will have a much different tolerance than those organization using keychain aware applications extensively.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE) macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it was not encrypted. When the system is not in use the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume the encryption keys remain in memory.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system that is protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on as well as USB or other open device ports are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to desk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.</xhtml:p>

            </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk acceptable time period. The default value for "standbydelay" is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most Desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored less physically secure areas with confidential data this value might be adjusted. The desktop or would have to retain power so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked however.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back in to system when it resumes.</xhtml:p>

This is especially important when a smartcard is being used for console login. Keychains need to be protected by more than a pin in order to be secured and the default behavior with a smartcard will result in a pin for the login password.

         <xhtml:p>Account management is a central part of security for any computer system including macOS. General practices should be followed to ensure that all accounts on a system are still needed and that default accounts have been removed. Users with admin roles should have distinct accounts for Admin functions as well as day to day work where the passwords are different and known only by the user assigned to the account. Accounts with Elevated privileges should not be easily discerned from the account name from standard accounts.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>When any computer system is added to a Directory System there are additional controls available including user account management that are not available in a standalone computer. One of the drawbacks is the local computer is no longer in control of the accounts that can access or manage it if given permission. For macOS if the computer is connected to a Directory any standard user can now login to the computer at console which by default may be desirable or not depending on the use case. If an admin group is allowed to administer the local computer the membership of that group is controlled completely in the Directory.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>macOS computers connected to a Directory should be configured so that the risk is appropriate for the mission use of the computer. Only those accounts that require local authentication should be allowed, only required administrator accounts should be in the local administrator group. Authenticated Users for console access and Domain Admins for Administration may be too broad or too limited</xhtml:p>

In the case of the guest folder the folder remains in place without a GUI option to remove it. If at some point in the future a Guest account is needed it will be re-created.

            <xhtml:p>Starting with Safari 10 and continuing with 11 Apple changed the model on how the built-in web browser handles Internet Plug-Ins. Instead of using a global approach where the Plug-in is either on or off for all sites the default decision is about allowing, not allowing, or allowing permanently for a specific site that is visited. Other browsers are moving to stop using Plug-ins altogether and insist on the use of HTML 5 for rich content. Only allowing Plug-in content from specific sites is a viable security option. In the Security Preferences, Plug-in settings it is possible to override the security feature and enable Plug-in content globally by Plug-in. With the controls planned in other macOS browsers allowing content globally is likely to put Safari users more at risk than other browser users.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>With 10.9 Apple expanded the capability of the App Store to automatically download macOS applications that were purchased in the App Store on another Mac. This feature can be very desirable for personal Macs or in a small business setting so that all purchased software through Apple's App Store is provisioned on all macOS Computers, just like iOS. This feature may not be desirable in Enterprise environments where the expectations of handling software licenses, tracking software inventory and personal software are different.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Please evaluate your organizations expectations about the use of personal software and software license tracking to align with this setting.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For those organizations that are using Enterprise Apple IDs for their employees the reverse is true. If the user has the username and password for their Apple ID and software is being purchased on that account the user could download the software on other computers they have access to.</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>EFI is the software link between the motherboard hardware and the software operating system. EFI determines which partition or disk to load macOS from, it also determines whether the user can enter single-user mode. The main reasons to set a firmware password have been protections against an alternative boot disk, protection against a passwordless root shell through single user mode and protection against firewire DMA attacks. In the past it was not difficult to reset the firmware password by removing RAM but it did make tampering slightly harder and having to remove RAM remediated memory scraping attacks through DMA. It has always been difficult to Manage the firmware password on macOS computers, though some tools did make it much easier.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Apple patched OS X in 10.7 to mitigate the DMA attacks and the use of FileVault 2 Full-Disk Encryption mitigates the risk of damage to the boot volume if an unauthorized user uses a different boot volume or uses Single User Mode. Apple's reliance on the recovery partition and the additional features it provides make controls that do not allow the user to boot into the recovery partition less attractive.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Starting in Late 2010 with the MacBook Air Apple has slowly updated the requirements to recover from a lost firmware password. Apple only supports taking the computer to an Apple authorized service provider. This change makes managing the firmware password effectively more critical if it is used.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Setting the firmware password may be good practice in some environments. We cannot recommend it as a standard security practice at this time.</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>Apple has provided services for several years that allowed a user to reset a local account password on a computer using their Apple ID and a service to store the FileVault Master Password with Apple that would be controlled by access to an Apple ID. These distinct services have been more cleanly integrated starting in 10.12.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>This integrated service for password and decryption is a concern in Enterprise environments. Normal Enterprise management controls mitigate the risk of external control of organizational systems. The user of the system already has the ability to unlock the disk in order to login and use it and some form of password recovery function is likely already in place for any approved accounts. In addition:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>You cannot reset anything but a local account</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>You need physical access to the computer on a network that can phone home to Apple</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Enterprise FileVault management precludes the use of Apple's personal encryption recovery tied to a User's Apple ID</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>The current login keychain will have to be discarded unless the user remembers the old password</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>This service allows for organizational computer users to utilize AppleIDs for encryption key escrow and user account management. The use of Apple's services rather than Enterprise services may be considered inappropriate.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>With macOS 10.12 Sierra Apple has introduced Siri from iOS to macOS. While there are data spillage concerns with use of software data gathering personal assistants the risk here does not seem greater in sending queries to Apple through Siri than in sending search terms in a browser to Google or Microsoft. While it is possible that Siri will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches which could, in theory, tell Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed this appears be an edge use case.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In cases where sensitive and protected data is processed and Siri could help a user navigate their machine and expose that information it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of it's requirements.</xhtml:p>

Information like sports scores, weather, movie times and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri. None of the standard use cases should be more risky than already approved activity. Where "normal" user activity is already limited Siri use should be controlled as well.</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>With the release of macOS 10.12 Apple introduced a feature where the owner of an Apple Watch can lock and unlock their screen simply by being within range of a 10.12 computer when both devices are using the same AppleID with iCloud active. The benefit of not leaving the computer unlocked while the user is out of sight and readying the computer to resume work when the user returns without having to type in a password or insert a smartcard does seem attractive to people who have the Apple Watch. It is a continuation of other features like hand-off and continuity for the multiple Apple products users who have grown to expect their devices to work together.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>For the screen unlock capability in particular it may not be attractive to organizations that are managing Apple devices and credentials. The capability allows a user to unlock their computer tied to an Enterprise account with a personal token that is not managed or controlled by the Enterprise. If the user loses their watch revoking the credential that can unlock the screen might be problematic.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Unless Enterprise control of the watch as a token tied to a user identity can be achieved Apple Watches should not be used for screen unlocks. The risk of an auto-lock based on the user being out of proximity may still be acceptable if possible to do lock only.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>This functionality does require the computer to be logged in to iCloud. If iCloud is disabled the Apple watch lock and unlock will not be possible.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>AirDrop is Apple's built-in on demand ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are nearby to each other.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In many ways this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Even with all of these positives some environments may wish to disable AirDrop. Organizations where Bluetooth and Wireless are not used will disable AirDrop by blocking it's necessary interfaces. Organizations that have disabled USB and other pluggable storage mechanisms and have blocked all unmanaged cloud and transfer solutions for DLP may want to disable AirDrop as well.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>AirDrop should be used with Contacts only to limit attacks.</xhtml:p>
