jTDS 1.2.8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
jTDS JDBC Driver v1.2.8 is used, unmodified, by CIS-CAT for database-related 
functions. jTDS is governed by the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
For more information, see:

  http://jtds.sourceforge.net/license.html

"jTDS is Free Software. jTDS is made available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License. The LGPL is sufficiently flexible to allow the use of jTDS in both open 
source and commercial projects. Using jTDS is considered to be dynamic linking; hence our 
interpretation of the LGPL is that the use of the unmodified jTDS source or binary does 
not affect the license of your application code.

If you modify jTDS and redistribute your modifications, the LGPL applies, basically 
meaning that you'll have to make the modified version publicly available under the LGPL 
license too. This ensures that all users of the software have access to all future 
improvements.

jTDS was initially based on software released under a BSD license by CDS Networks, Inc. 
and/or Craig Spannring, the author of the original FreeTDS JDBC driver from which jTDS 
is derived. Between releases 0.8.1 and 0.9 jTDS was completely rewritten so the original 
BSD license no longer applies."

CIS-CAT is processed with ProGuard. CIS-CAT does not include nor link

"ProGuard is free. You can use it freely for processing your applications, 
commercial or not. Your code obviously remains yours after having been processed, 
and its license can remain the same.

ProGuard itself is copyrighted, but its distribution license provides you with 
some rights for modifying and redistributing its code and its documentation. 
More specifically, ProGuard is distributed under the terms of the GNU General 
Public License (GPL), version 2, as published by the Free Software Foundation 
(FSF). In short, this means that you may freely redistribute the program, 
modified or as is, on the condition that you make the complete source code 
available as well. If you develop a program that is linked with ProGuard, the 
program as a whole has to be distributed at no charge under the GPL. I am 
granting a special exception to the latter clause (in wording suggested by 
the FSF), for combinations with the following stand-alone applications: 
Apache Ant, Apache Maven, the Eclipse Java IDE, the Sun NetBeans Java IDE, 
the Sun JME Wireless Toolkit, and the Javaground Tools.

The ProGuard user documentation represents an important part of this work. 
It may only be redistributed without changes, along with the unmodified version 
of the code."
